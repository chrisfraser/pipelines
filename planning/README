This is a support file for the "planning" project.

====================================================================================
The Setup
====================================================================================
You will need the following programs installed

  * Coding IDE (prefer brackets)
  * Node.js (add it to your PATH)
  * GIT
  * Install Grunt (http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
  
1) Open command prompt to this dir and initialize it
    -> npm install
2) Spin up express server
    -> node server.js
3) Navigate to the server URL
    -> http://localhost:8088/

====================================================================================
Installing Grunt
====================================================================================
1) Open a command window to this dir
2) Issue the following commands to install Grunt
      -> npm install -g grunt-cli
      -> npm install (resolves all the dev dependencies)
      -> grunt (this should run the default task)
3) Run Grunt in watch mode to automatically compile our less/js code
      -> grunt watch

====================================================================================
A Note on Minification (AngularJS)
====================================================================================
AngularJS minification :: http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_05

Since angular infers the controller's dependencies from the names of arguments to the 
controller's constructor function, if you were to minify the JavaScript code, all of
its function arguments would be minified as well, and the dependency injector would
not be able to identify services correctly.

To overcome issues caused by minification, just assign an array with service identifier
strings into the $inject property of the controller function, just like the last line 
in the snippet (commented out) suggests:

PhoneListCtrl.$inject = ['$scope', '$http'];
or
var PhoneListCtrl = ['$scope', '$http', function($scope, $http) { /* constructor body */ }];
